This is my first full-stack web app which was developed for Project 2 of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program. It provides basic functionality to view cryptocurrency projects with information taken from the CoinMarketCap API. It utilizes multiple database tables to handle user profiles and store watchlist data.

### Technologies Used

- Javascript
- HTML/CSS
- MaterializeCSS
- EJS
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize
- B-crypt / Passport
- Heroku
- CoinMarketCap API

### Thoughts

I really enjoy projects because they provide the chance to slow down and better understand the concepts that our instructors have been attempting to cram into our brains for the past 2 weeks. I didn't know much about backend before this unit, but it turns out I like it and would ideally work on full-stack projects. Databases will still take some getting used to, but the main concepts are clear to me and I realize that I just need to take more time to familiarize myself with Sequelize documentation.

### Scope Creep

I had a ton of ideas about where I could go with this second project. Scope creep was an issue even though I was warned and on the lookout. Potential features included: 

- Alert functionality
- Wallet address tracker
- Miner API integration
- AWS deployment
- Portfolio tracking (with charting)

I spend about 4-5 hours looking into options before deciding to integrate a Portfolio. Scope creep continued when working on that and on reflection I realize that I would work on 'nice to have's' before making sure the core functionality worked. I didn't expect it, but I really appreciate how these projects are helping me to develop my time management skills.    

### Challenges

There were a couple bugs that really derailed my progress mid-week. These were the kind of bugs that didn't really have an answer, you just had to work around them. Sequelize also held me back a few times, but I think part of that came from me not fully understanding its features and reading through all of its documentation. I'm very currious to see what other model options are available and if I gravitate to them more.  

### Next Steps

I wish I had more time to work on this project. I cleaned it up and removed the unfinished lingering pieces because I would rather have a live site that looks minimal but complete over one with clearly unfinished areas. I have tons of ideas for additional components, however, and may work on implementing one or two of them to make the site feel more complete. I'm thinking either a portfolio section or a more info section.
